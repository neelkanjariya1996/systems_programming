This assignment is divided into two parts.

1. mapper part:
    Mapper thread takes input tuples (expected as below format) from a file in the form of (userid,action,topic) and converts them into another tuple of form (userid,topic,score). The thread parses the input string and converts it into tuples of required form as per rules mentioned in the assignment using standard string parsing logic.
Input Tuple Format: "(4 char userID, 1 char action, 15 char topic)"

2. Reducer part: 
    Each new user is processed by an individual thread. Each thread takes input in the form of (userid, topic, score) and converts them into output tuple into the form of (userid, topic, totalscore). Each thread keeps an unordered map to keep a tally of total score per topic for a user.

Input file is stored as input.txt in the project directory.

Running the program:
1. make
2. ./output buffer_size consumer_threads input_file
